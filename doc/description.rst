General description
======================

The OSI Validator is a validation framework for the field values of OSI messages. It recursively checks the compliance of an OSI message of type ``SensorData``, ``SensorView`` or ``GroundTruth`` according to predefined rules. It was developed due to the need of validation of a huge amount of OSI messages which cannot be validated manually.
