Usage
=======

Example
----------------
After installation you can call the command ``osivalidator`` in your terminal which has the following usage:

.. code-block:: bash

    usage: osivalidator [-h] [--rules RULES]
                        [--type {SensorView,GroundTruth,SensorData}]
                        [--output OUTPUT] [--timesteps TIMESTEPS] [--debug]
                        [--verbose] [--parallel] [--format {separated,None}]
                        data

    Validate data defined at the input

    positional arguments:
    data                  Path to the file with OSI-serialized data.

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --rules RULES, -r RULES
                            Directory with text files containig rules.
    --type {SensorView,GroundTruth,SensorData}, -t {SensorView,GroundTruth,SensorData}
                            Name of the type used to serialize data.
    --output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT
                            Output folder of the log files.
    --timesteps TIMESTEPS
                            Number of timesteps to analyze. If -1, all.
    --debug               Set the debug mode to ON.
    --verbose, -v         Set the verbose mode to ON.
    --parallel, -p        Set parallel mode to ON.
    --format {separated,None}, -f {separated,None}
                            Set the format type of the trace.

To run the validation first you need an OSI trace file which consists of multiple OSI messages. 
In the directory ``data`` we already have two OSI trace files provided which are called ``small_test.osi.lzma`` (a `lzma <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm>`_ compressed trace file with length separation of OSI messages) and a ``small_test.txt.lzma`` (a `lzma <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm>`_ compressed trace file with the ``$$__$$`` separator which in future will be depracted. Use the ``txt2osi.py`` of the OSI repo in the format directory to convert from ``*.txt`` to ``*.osi`` files or from ``*.txt.lzma`` to ``*.osi.lzma``). See usage below:

.. code-block:: bash

    usage: txt2osi converter [-h] [--file FILE]
                            [--type {SensorView,GroundTruth,SensorData}]
                            [--output OUTPUT] [--compress]

    Convert txt trace file to osi trace files.

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --file FILE, -f FILE  Path to the file with serialized data.
    --type {SensorView,GroundTruth,SensorData}, -t {SensorView,GroundTruth,SensorData}
                            Name of the type used to serialize data.
    --output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT
                            Output name of the file.
    --compress, -c        Compress the output to a lzma file.

To validate the trace files you simply call ``osivalidator`` and provide the path to the trace:

.. code-block:: bash

    osivalidator --data data/small_test.osi.lzma
    osivalidator --data data/small_test.txt.lzma -f separated

You can also validate the traces in parallel to increase the speed of the validation by providing ``-p`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

    osivalidator --data data/small_test.osi.lzma -p
    osivalidator --data data/small_test.txt.lzma -f separated -p


After successfully running the validation the following output is generated:

The Output is a report of how many errors (here 27) and warnings (here 5) were found in the osi-message according to the defined rules. The rules can be found under the tag ``\rules`` in the \*.proto files from the `osi github <https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/open-simulation-interface>`_ or in the `requirements folder <https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/osi-validation/tree/master/requirements-osi-3>`_ from osi-validation as \*.yml files (for more information see :ref:`commenting`).  Currently an error is thrown when a field is not set. A warning is thrown when a field is set but do not comply with the defined rules. For each error and warning there is a description on which timestamp it was found, the path to the rule and the path to the osi-message. The general format is:
