# KPIs of OSI

## Presentation

As a scrum team, we would like to create a data validity KPI (requirements) for each message of OSI.

The KPI should be followed to create a OSI 3 message to be considered as *valid*.

These KPI requirements are avalaible here on a Doxygen documentation: http://opensimulationinterface.github.io/osi-validation/KPIs/

## How to deploy the Doxygen documentation

### Requirements (Linux only)

- Doxygen (on Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install doxygen`)
- make

### Deploy

Run in the KPIs folder: `make`

To clean the folder: `make clean`
